#Local Service Finder

A responsive frontend application to browse and filter local services.

## Project Overview
Local Service Finder is a frontend-only web application designed to simulate a real-world service discovery platform. It focuses on core UI and UX behaviors such as searching, filtering, loading states, and responsive layouts, without relying on a backend or external APIs. The project demonstrates how dynamic user interactions can be handled entirely on the client side using clean, structured JavaScript.
This project was built as part of a hackathon case study to demonstrate frontend UI behavior.
