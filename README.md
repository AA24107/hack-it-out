#Local Service Finder

A responsive frontend application to browse and filter local services.

## Project Overview
Local Service Finder is a frontend-only web application designed to simulate a real-world service discovery platform. It focuses on core UI and UX behaviors such as searching, filtering, loading states, and responsive layouts, without relying on a backend or external APIs. The project demonstrates how dynamic user interactions can be handled entirely on the client side using clean, structured JavaScript.
This project was built as part of a hackathon case study to demonstrate frontend UI behavior. 

## Features
- Card-based service listings
- Real-time search
- Filters by category, location, and availability
- Loading state (simulated)
- Empty result state
- Hover effects and smooth UI transitions
- Fully responsive (desktop, tablet, mobile)

## Tech Stack
- HTML
- CSS (Bootstrap + custom CSS)
- JavaScript (Vanilla)

## How to Run
Open `index.html` using Live Server or any browser.
